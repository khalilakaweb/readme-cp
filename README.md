# Full Stack Web Developer Journey

I am excited to take the next step in my career as a full stack web developer. During my Bootcamp experience, I gained hands-on expertise with both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose.

This training provided me with a comprehensive understanding of every layer of web application developmentâ€”from building responsive, dynamic user interfaces to managing servers and databases. I developed strong problem-solving and debugging skills, as well as effective teamwork, communication, and time management abilities.

The Bootcamp empowered me to approach challenges with confidence, think analytically like a developer, and quickly adapt to new tools and frameworks. I am now fully prepared to apply my skills to real-world projects and continue to grow as a professional full stack developer.
